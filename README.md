Cheesecake Webpage

This is a demo cheesecake bakery site for a friend. This is a revamp of the original site that was created with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. Now to continue to enhance my skills in React, I've decided to build Cheesecakes 2.0. Users can place their orders directly from the site and pay with PayPal, debit or Credit Card.

How It's Made:
Tech used: React, PayPal REST API

<!-- Description
How did you build this project. Add all details -->

Optimizations
I plan to integrate a backend component using NodeJs and Express. I would like for the owner of the business to be able to have access to each cheesecake order (outside of PayPal). Eventually I would like to add an email component as well, which will email the user once the order has been placed and also email the business owner and order summary.

Also, I plan to add Redux to site for state management.

<!-- You don't have to include this section but interviewers love that you can not only deliver a final product that looks great but also functions efficiently. Did you write something then refactor it later and the result was 5x faster than the original implementation? Did you cache your assets? Things that you write in this section are GREAT to bring up in interviews and you can use this section as reference when studying for technical interviews! -->

Lessons Learned:
No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Also, as an engineer you never feel as if a project is finished. I'm continuing to research ways to optimize this site and also consulting the Cheesecake business owner for feedback. I definitely plan to continue adding to this site.




# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
